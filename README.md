# AWS Zero Trust IAM Platform with Least-Privilege Automation

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Zero Trust Identity and Access Management (IAM) Platform** on AWS with automated least-privilege enforcement.  
Our solution is designed to:
- Enforce strict identity security
- Automate policy enforcement
- Detect and remediate risky IAM configurations in near real-time
