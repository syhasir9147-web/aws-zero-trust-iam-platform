# AWS Zero Trust IAM Platform with Least-Privilege Automation

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a **Zero Trust Identity & Access Management (IAM) Platform** on AWS, designed to:
- Enforce least-privilege access across AWS accounts
- Automate IAM policy compliance checks and remediation
- Provide end-to-end monitoring, alerting, and logging
- Reduce security risks in cloud environments

---

## ðŸ›  Key Features
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with Organizational Unit-level Service Control Policies (SCPs)
- **Real-time IAM compliance checks** using AWS Config & Access Analyzer
- **Automated detection & remediation** of risky IAM policies with Amazon EventBridge + AWS Lambda
- **Centralized monitoring & logging** using AWS CloudTrail, Amazon GuardDuty, and DynamoDB
- **Instant alerts** with Amazon CloudWatch Alarms + SNS notifications

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Outcomes
âœ… 40â€“60% reduction in over-privileged IAM roles  
âœ… IAM misconfigurations flagged within **2 minutes**  
âœ… 100% IAM usage logs monitored across accounts  
âœ… Zero Trust session enforcement reduced risk by ~50%
